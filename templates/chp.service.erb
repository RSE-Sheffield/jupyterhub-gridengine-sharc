# Ideally we'd use 'ProtectHome=yes' to make /home, /root and /run/user inaccessible and
# empty to this service; however, qsub would then fail as it would annoyingly error when trying
# to read '$HOME/.sge_aliases'.  An alternative would be 'ProtectHome=read-only' but this
# prevents us from writing error logs to users' home directories.  We therefore need:
#ProtectHome=no

# Sets up a new file system namespace for the executed processes and mounts
# private /tmp and /var/tmp directories inside it that is not shared by
# processes outside of the namespace.  All temporary files created by a service
# in these directories will be removed after the service is stopped.
